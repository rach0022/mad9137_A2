# Assignment2: Event List

## Description

In this assignment you will be creating an iOS application that will display a list of events in the main view of the application using a TableView. Each event’s title will be listed in a separate cell of TableView in this initial view.  A NavigationController will be embedded in this initial TableView, and a segue will be connected from the Prototype Cell of the TableView to the second ViewController.

Clicking on any of the cells in table will transition the user to a second view that will have a label to display the event title, and the date. It will also have a textView to display the event description. The textView must be set to not allow editing, of its text, and be able to detect Phone Numbers, web Links and Addresses.
